  <h2>About</h2>
<p>I am Wilfried‑Guth Professor of Constitutional Political Economy and Competition Policy at the University of Freiburg (since 2012). I earned a Diplom in Economics (quantitative track) from Kiel and a PhD from LMU Munich (2004) on public pensions and immigration. Further study visits included the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, Boston University, and the University of Göttingen. Before joining Freiburg, I held a junior professorship in International Economic Policy at the University of Paderborn and, between 2009 and 2011, I served as acting professor of public finance at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and as acting professor of institutional economics at Philipps University Marburg.</p>

<p><strong>Research.</strong> My work focuses on institutions, factor mobility (especially migration), and conflict, as well as a modern interpretation of ordoliberalism in the Freiburg tradition. My papers appear in journals across economics and political science (e.g., <em>The Economic Journal</em>, <em>Journal of International Economics</em>, <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, <em>Journal of Peace Research</em>). I have been involved in a range of externally funded research projects. I received the University of Freiburg’s Bertha‑Ottenstein Prize (2018) for research on polygyny and conflict, and I was a Global Shifts Visiting Scholar at Perry World House (University of Pennsylvania).</p>

<p><strong>Teaching &amp; service.</strong> I teach institutional and applied micro fields, including New Institutional Economics and Law &amp; Economics. I received the University Teaching Prize (2017) and several student awards. Within the University of Freiburg, I served as Vice Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Behavioral Sciences and chaired joint study committees with the University of Education Freiburg. I am a member of the University’s Ethics Committee and serve, among others, on the Board of Trustees of the Walter Eucken Institute and the Scientific Advisory Board of the Forum Ordnungspolitik.</p>
